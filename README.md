##Sudoku Solver

This is my first attempt at making a sudoku solver in ruby.

###Usage

To use the program, make a game file and save it in the same directory as the ruby script. Then, change the second line in the make_puzzle method with the name of the file.

After that, run the script!

###Game File Instructions
Each row in the sudo grid is a letter from A to I and each column is a number 1 to 9. So the address of top left cell is A1, the top right is A9, the bottom left is I1 and so on.

The game file is a simple text file representing the initial state of the gamme. Each line in the file should be of the form:
>X=Y
where X is the cell address and Y is the number in the cell.

At this time, the file format doesn't tolerate any deviations, so don't put any spaces or comments.
